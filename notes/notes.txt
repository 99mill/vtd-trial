# Wine Vintage Transition Visualization Tool - Development Log

## Date: [Current Date]

### Progress Summary
We have made significant progress in developing the Wine Vintage Transition Visualization Tool. Our focus has shifted from a Python-based solution to a web-based implementation using React, which offers better interactivity and easier integration with modern web technologies.

### Accomplished Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialized a React project structure
   - Set up basic component hierarchy (App, BrandCard, ParentSKUSection, Timeline)

2. **Data Structure**
   - Defined a JSON format for storing wine vintage data
   - Created a mock dataset for development and testing purposes

3. **UI Components**
   - Implemented BrandCard component to represent each brand
   - Created ParentSKUSection component to display data for each SKU
   - Developed a basic Timeline component for visualizing vintage transitions

4. **Timeline Visualization**
   - Implemented a single x-axis timeline with year markers
   - Added separate rows for Ideal and Planned vintage transitions
   - Integrated dynamic positioning of timeline bars based on date ranges

5. **Styling**
   - Created CSS files for each component (App.css, BrandCard.css, ParentSKUSection.css, Timeline.css)
   - Implemented responsive design principles for better display across devices

### Current Focus
- Refining the Timeline component to accurately represent vintage transitions
- Improving the visual design of the timeline, including color coding for different vintages
- Ensuring the layout fits well within the ParentSKUSection

### Pending Tasks

1. **Data Input**
   - Implement Excel file reading functionality (possibly using a backend service or library like SheetJS)
   - Convert Excel dates to JavaScript Date objects

2. **Data Processing**
   - Implement grouping by Brand and ParentSKU
   - Sort vintages chronologically for each product

3. **Interactivity**
   - Add hover effects to display detailed information about each vintage
   - Implement zooming and panning for the timeline (if required)

4. **Output Generation**
   - Develop functionality to export visualizations as static PNG images
   - Create a method to save the interactive visualization as an HTML file

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Test and optimize for handling up to 100 Brand-ParentSKU combinations
   - Implement lazy loading or pagination if necessary for large datasets

6. **Documentation**
   - Create a README file with installation and usage instructions
   - Add inline comments and documentation for key functions

### Next Steps
1. Complete the refinement of the Timeline component
2. Implement data input functionality to read from Excel files
3. Enhance interactivity of the visualization with hover effects and detailed information display
4. Begin work on the output generation features (PNG export, HTML save)

### Technical Decisions and Rationale
- Chose React for frontend development due to its component-based architecture and wide community support
- Decided against using D3.js for now, opting for a simpler CSS-based approach for the initial implementation
- Kept the option open to integrate D3.js later if more complex visualizations are required

### Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge: Representing multiple vintages on a single timeline
  Solution: Implemented separate rows for Ideal and Planned transitions, with color-coding for different vintages
- Challenge: Dynamically positioning timeline elements
  Solution: Calculated positions based on date ranges and total timeline width

This development log reflects our current progress and outlines the next steps in the project. We've made significant strides in setting up the basic structure and visualization, but there's still work to be done in terms of data input, processing, and advanced features.
